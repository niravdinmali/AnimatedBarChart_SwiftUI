# AnimatedBarChart_SwiftUI

Thanks to Lets Build That App guys for putting this video tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lSJzzI2fj8) on animated bar charts with in-line static data. 
I am learning SwiftUI and changed the code to take data from an array of tuples and loop through it for display.

Installation: Unzip, open the xcode project file and run.
